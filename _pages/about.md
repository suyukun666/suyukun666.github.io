I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology ([SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/)) and Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)), advised by Prof. [Qingyao Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/qysite/) and Prof. [Guosheng Lin](https://guosheng.github.io/). I also work closely with Dr. [Fengyun Rao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=38dACd4AAAAJ&hl=en) in research.
