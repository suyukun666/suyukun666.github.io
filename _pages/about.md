**I am an senior researcher (through Â§ßÂíñËÆ°Âàí) in [Tencent Wechat AI Group](https://ai.weixin.qq.com/) after graduation, with the goal of conducting multi-modal learning research in artificial intelligence. Prior to joining Wechat, I was an intern at [Sensetime](https://www.sensetime.com/cn) (Singapore) 3D vision group.**

I received my Ph.D. from the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology ([SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/)) and Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)), advised by Prof. [Qingyao Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/qysite/) and Prof. [Guosheng Lin](https://guosheng.github.io/). I also work closely with Dr. [Fengyun Rao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=38dACd4AAAAJ&hl=en) in research.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Research Interests

- **Fundamental Vision:** Detection, Segmentation, and Restoration
- **Multi-Modal Learning:** Variant CLIP and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
